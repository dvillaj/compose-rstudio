New Project
================

Each directory in this template project has a _README.md_ file that briefly
describes its intended purpose.

This project follows a directory to use the
[ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net) package, more information about
ProjectTemplate can be found in <config/README.md>.

This _README.md_ file should be used as an overview of this project so that
another analyst (or you) can get a quick glance of the research question,
data processing, and analysis approach (e.g. if specific analysis is required,
and where script for that analysis is found).
